Ooh man my life is imploding

Gonna work on this, maybe I have a saving grace coming up

To get started I'm referencing another extension I made, stil stuck on manifest v2

https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/save-tabs-chrome-extension/tree/master/save-tabs/extension

Got these gatteron reds

There is a blemish/dumb reminder from myself on this other monitor I'm using where I used a razor blade to scratch at the surface of the display permanently marking it... it could be fixed with epoxy to make the light go straight again but ehh

Compute really is cheap nowadays, I've got a 2x1080P setup with an optiplex 9010 i7 4GB graphics card with Ubuntu

Can run a business with that, but what is the business

My problem right now is I work 4x10 hr days so when I try to freelance the job has to be something I can complete in say 2-3 hrs or else I go into another day/wait 10 hr block... unless it's the 3 days off.

In which case it's about lining up jobs and applying costs money

So far while I have done work for 3 different people I have not gotten paid ha

It's funny I have this urge to draw a UI can't just write it with code

Maybe if I had the figma skills would use that

Ugh... can't help but feel this project is a waste of time

Struggling with the layers of messaging, I've left myself notes in the past too

4:05 PM

Back on, I am making this harder than it needs to be

The filters should be kept on the DOM level via localStorage not in background.js

This info is not private or secret

The popup-ui is just an interface to see/modify the filter
